            <h2>My name is Emmanuella and living the simple life saved me.</h2>
             
            <p><strong>I am a Professional chef</strong>. I had so many things that
             i thought that i loved, but the truth is i couldn't even appreciate any of it
             because there was too much.</p>
            <p>Things were terrible. I had a job that i hated, 
            a home that i didn't want to live in, and i couldn't hold a relationship.</p>
            <hr>

           <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
            <p><strong>I was on the verge of breakdown, when i got rid of everything</strong>.
            I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage,
            sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment and i quit my job.</p>
            <p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a mess,
            I didn't know whatelse to do and it worked. </p>
             <hr>
        
            <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
            <p>Now that i'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I am less stressed
             and i enjoy my work even better, and i have more free time to enjoy.</p>
             <p>With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like i had no choice but to start sharing how i did it</strong>, and
             how other can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why i started this site!</p>
